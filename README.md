Our proposed project entitled “Mousam” provides better information regarding weather parameters for better decisions to save lives and livelihoods. 
In this era of natural disasters, we hope that this project has great significance. 
We have gathered the required data from CUSAT atmospheric department to do this work. 

Here we have created a visualization for the movement of wind in the Indian Subcontinent from October 1st to November 17th.
